# Mars Invaders (SpaceInvaders project) (English)

This is the resulting project of my Advanced Computer Graphic/Image Synthesis course, at the [University of Pau UPPA](https://www.univ-pau.fr/en/home.html). 

The aim of the assignement was to create a JavaScript game using the WebGL graphic API, in the fashion of the popular game Space Invaders.

## How to use

This visualizer use JavaScript so you only need a WebGL capable browser!

You can access the project by those links:

* [The game, Mars Invaders](https://konsciencegit.github.io/SpaceInvaders/src/html/marsInvaders.html)
* [The assignement report](https://konsciencegit.github.io/SpaceInvaders/rapport.html) (in French).

It is recommended to use a personal computer, as the game's controls are keyboard inputs only (for now), but you can still access the documentation and the game main menu on a mobile device.

## What is this

This is a small video game made in the scope of a school assignement. The subject was to create a Space Invaders-like game using Javascript and the WebGL graphic API.

This programm features:
* A basic game logic loop similar to Space Invaders with
  * Player input processing
  * Projectile collision detection
  * Smart enemy fire aiming
  * Non-granular evolutive difficulty
  * Score system
  * Player health and game over mechanism

* Detailed Background graphisms
  * A spinning highly accurate model of Mars, [you can see it in details on my github here](https://github.com/KonscienceGit/MarsJS).
  * A high definition skybox picturing the Milky Way

* Basic 3D modeled objects (in blender)

* Many computer graphics techniques that can be tweaked in real-time:
  * Normal mapping
  * Displacement mapping
  * UV mapping
  * Anisotropic filtering
  * Basic tessellation
  * Backface culling (skybox)
  * Basic alteration of object's Z-buffer rendering order (skybox)
